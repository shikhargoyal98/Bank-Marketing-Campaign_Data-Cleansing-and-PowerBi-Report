Overview:

This project aims to analyze a dataset related to a direct marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict the success of the campaign in terms of clients subscribing to a term deposit through phone calls. The dataset contains various attributes of clients, campaign details, and socio-economic factors.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the classic bank marketing dataset originally shared in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes information about bank clients, campaign details, and socio-economic factors. The target variable ('y') indicates whether a client subscribed to a term deposit ('yes' or 'no').

Approach:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze distributions, correlations, and visualize relationships between variables.

Insights and Recommendations: Derive actionable insights and propose strategies for improving future marketing campaigns.
